## WEEK 2 - WORKSHOP: Version Control & GitHub

#### In preparation for this week:
1. join the course's **Slack** workspace. (you'll receive an invite on your Columbia email)
2. get a [**GitHub**](https://github.com) account if you don't have one, and add your handle on the Google sheet we've set up for that purpose.
3. install [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) in your computer
4. read/listen/watch as much as you can from the annotated materials below



---

**git** and **GitHub** have done a great job of putting together easy-to-use resources. Be advised that neither git nor GitHub are very intuitive at first, so you may want to start with some of the resources listed below, and immediately get to play around with them.

#### git

* [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) which is a perfect introduction to git
* [visualizing git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) to help you understand visuallly what happens at each step of using git
* [Git Cheatsheets](https://training.github.com) put together by the GitHub team
* [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book if you're getting really serious about git

#### GitHub

* the [GitHub Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides) YouTube channel
* [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com) hands-on tutorials put together by GitHub
* [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is a 5-minute tutorial to understand the basics of team collaboration through GitHub
* [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/) is a great place to start at the source


**PLEASE NOTE** that GitHub now requires a **personal access token** for authentication, instead of a password. When interacting with GitHub from the command line, you may get the following message:
```
Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use personal access token instead.
```
To solve this issue, follow these [**instructions**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create your personal token and use it instead of a password. Make sure to set the expiration date for the duration of the course. 



#### Atom

Although it's probably best to start with the command line, once you're comfortable coding in a text editor, it might start to make sense to also interact with git and GitHub from your text editor as well. Atom is an open source text editor - supported by GitHub - with a nice integration with git and GitHub (aka an IDE). Take a look at

* the [Version Control in Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/version-control-in-atom/) and [GitHub package](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/github-package/) chapters from the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) to understand the basics of working with git and GitHub from Atom
* [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) if you want to learn more about other packages that will make it easier to code in your language of choice
* [a quick video overview of Atom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5POoGSrtGg)
